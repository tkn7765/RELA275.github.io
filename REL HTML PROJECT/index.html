                        <p style="text-align: center;" class="lead">There was a family that consisted of 6 people. 
                            These people were Lehi (The father and Prophet at the time), Sariah (The Mother), and there 4 kids, Laman, Lemuel, Sam and Nephi. 
                            Lehi was commanded by God to leave Jerusalem because it was going to be destroyed. So he took his family and others who believed into the wilderness and left. 
                            Laman and Lemuel weren't on board to leave but did so anyway. But Nephi and Sam we willing to follow their father's words with faith. 
                            On their journey they encountered many hardships but also received lots of blessings. The lord prepared a way for them to grow and to learn. They were able to receive the Gold Plates and to learn a lot from those as well. 
                            Eventually along the journey, Lehi received the vision of the Tree of life to help them to see what was there for them at the end for their faithfulness. <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/2?lang=eng" target="_blank"> <br> (1 Nephi 2-5, 7)</a> </p>

                        <h2>Vision of the Tree of Life</h2>
                        <p> At the start of Lehi's describes he describes being in an open field and seeing nothing but an angel. As Lehi Starts to follow him, he loses the angel and is lost in darkness. 
                            As he prays for help, he sees a bright light. As he looks up, directly in front of him is a large and spacious field and in the middle of it is a Tree. This Tree is the Tree of Life. <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8?lang=eng&id=5-10#p10" target="_blank">(1 Nephi 8:5-10)</a>
                            <br><br>
                            He goes forward and partakes of the fruit.
                            He describes the fruit as the "most sweet, above all that I ever before tasted." He describes as he eats the fruit, that his soul is filled with joy and wants to share that with his family because it is desirable above all else. <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8?lang=eng&id=11-12#p10" target="_blank">(1 Nephi 8:11-12)</a>
                            <br><br>
                            As he turns around, he sees his family. As he calls to them, Sariah, Nephi, and Sam follow but Laman and Lemuel decide to turn away. This is because they don't understand the blessings that they could have.  <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8?lang=eng&id=14-18,21#p10" target="_blank">(1 Nephi 8:14-18,21)</a>
                            The others come up and partake of the fruit and are filled with that same joy. After this he looks around to a great sight. He sees a great river, a big building on the other side of the river, an iron rod and a mist of darkness.
                            <br><br>
                            He describes the Iron rod as straight and narrow. Many people held tight to it following, it's guidance to the Tree of Life. But there were many people who let go and tried to walk around by themselves.
                            Some let go and were lost in the darkness and wandered around. Others tried to swim to the great buildings and were lost to the water. <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8?lang=eng&id=19-25,#p10" target="_blank">(1 Nephi 8:19-25)</a>
                            <br><br>
                            In these big buildings, there were people of all kind in it. They were described as "their manner of dress was exceedingly fine: and they were mocking and pointing their fingers" at those who were partaking of the fruit.
                            This caused many people to drop the fruit and be ashamed. After Lehi had described this scene, he concluded with his vision. <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8?lang=eng&id=26-29#p10" target="_blank">(1 Nephi 8:26-29)</a>

                        <p class="lead">I have learned so much as I have studied the story of the Tree of Life over and over again. I would love to taste of the fruit of life every day and have that rich taste in my life just as Lehi describes. I know that as I strive to keep my hand tight to the Iron Rod, I will see blessings in my life. 
                            I know that holding on to the rod will not always be easy but I know that I can do it. We need to find ways to build our foundation and to make sure that we are strong with everything that we do. If we mess up it's ok, we can repent and can become better.
                            I want to live with my family forever and I know that as long as I follow God's commandments I can find joy.
